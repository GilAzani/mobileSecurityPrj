# Mobile Security Project (raceHW with a virus)

This project is an extension of the RaceHW project from the Mobile Application course. In addition to the original RaceHW functionality, this project introduces a virus app. When the microphone permission is granted, the app will record the user's audio for an entire round of a game and send it to a specified email address.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure to set the following values in the `local.properties` file:

MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=fill_sender_email
EMAIL_PASS=fill_sender_email_password
EMAIL_TO=fill_destination_email
SMTP_HOST=fill_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=fill_smtp_port
